      <description>ðŸ‘” Hi! My name is Alexander. I am a mid-30s sales and support specialist based in Chemnitz, Germany.
After starting my career in heavy industry, I have found a home in the wide, wide SaaS world. Open Source, data protection, cycling and the great outdoors (random order) are just a few of the many things I am interested in.
I work at OpenProject and enjoy helping others get the most out of their project management.</description>
